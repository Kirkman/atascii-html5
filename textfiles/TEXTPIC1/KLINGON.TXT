It has twice the›power then most Starfleet ships, plus a›cloaking device, it also contains a›highly powerful twin Caliber engins,›capeable of warp 20+(no exact amount›has ever been recorded). The fire power›of this ship is enough to destroy a›large asteroid or a small moon. The›shilding can withstand 5meg neutons.›and the helm is magnetic, so the ship›can take any form (within in reason).›There are know to be only several of›these ships due to the cost and›materials used to create some parts.›   In conclusion I would like to add,›the ship is a formidable opponent for›any ship in Starfleet Command.››
