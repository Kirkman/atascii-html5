ATASCII HTML5 viewer
============

This is an experimental system for displaying Atari 8-bit ATASCII animations using Javascript and HTML5.

The system is not multiline aware yet, but at this point seems to play most animations with few glitches.


v0.3
---------------

* Numerous emulation fixes
* Rudimentary support for controlling playback speed

v0.2
---------------

* Added full-screen mode

v0.1
---------------

* First publicly-available version. Still a beta.


Resources
---------------

I found the following resources very handy in decoding the ATASCII format:
* [Mapping the Atari](http://www.atariarchives.org/mapping/appendix10.php) Appendix 10. 
* [ATASCII table](http://joyfulcoder.net/atari/atascii/) at joyfulcoder.net. 
* [ATASCII article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATASCII) at wikipedia.org. 

One big reason I was inspired to create this viewer was finding the old ["Break Movie Warehouse" website](https://web.archive.org/web/20000312095027/http://www.flash.net/~ambrosia/index3.html), which is archived in the Wayback Machine. This site was created by Tom D'Ambrosio to showcase the many ATASCII animations he created over the years. It included a Java applet by Tony Smolar which would play the animations in a web browser. But Java has changed a lot since then, and the applet doesn't work anymore.
